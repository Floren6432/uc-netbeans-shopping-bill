# uc-netbeans-shopping-bill

A Java Swing-based desktop application developed during my third year of university studies. This project simulates a shopping receipt system for a grocery store, allowing users to input product details (ID, name, quantity, price), add them to a cart table, view the current date and time, and print the final receipt.

Note:
This project is developed in Java and designed to be opened and run within the NetBeans IDE.

2. then open NetBeans, and follow these steps:
3. Go to File > Open Project
4. Navigate to the unzipped folder
5. Select the project folder (it should contain a nbproject folder)
6. Click Open Project

NetBeans will load the project and youâ€™re ready to build and run it.
